# Musical LEDs

This project was part of a coding workshop that I organized last year for middle school and high school students. The goal of this project is to teach the students how to program LED strips so that they could synchronize to music. These LED strips were then attached to dance costumes, and we showcased a musical LED dance performance on stage in front of an audience of over 100 people at the North Bend Theater, WA
