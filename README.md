# Musical LEDs

This project was part of a coding workshop that I organized last year for middle school and high school students. The goal of this project is to teach the students how to program LED strips so that they could synchronize to music. These LED strips were then attached to dance costumes, and we showcased a musical LED dance performance on stage in front of an audience of over 100 people at the North Bend Theater, WA
  
## Research and Prototyping

The first step is to learn how to program using the Arduino. The [Setting up and programming the Arduino for absolute beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJWR7dBuc18) tutorial helped me understand the basics of Arduino programming. It also helped me acquire the Arduino UNO kit and install the development environment on my laptop. After that the [Understanding how Breadboards work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfdaJ4z4u4w) tutorial helped me create [my first breadboard connection](https://github.com/dhruvkasarabada/Musical-LEDs/blob/770fdc4d481773e69207faeb1c47b1872d680d81/Musical-LEDs_BreadboardConnections.jpg)

After this, I researched into purchasing the right materials for this project, including the LED strips, LED strip connectors, and battery switch

Finally, the [FastLED Basics - Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ut4UK7612M) tutorial helped me understand how LED Strips can be programmed using the Arduino UNO. This is the [Wiring Diagram](https://github.com/dhruvkasarabada/Musical-LEDs/blob/0509d21e09bc2d4bf167a8c744f5c99da1c7b50c/MusicalLEDs_WiringDiagram.jpg) that I used for my LED strip connections.

Once the LED strips were successfully being lit, the next set of challenges was to synchronize the LEDs with the music, using various lighting effects like the rainbow, gradient, throb, and flash effects. This required me to ensure I had the right number of loops and delay times in my code, such that the lighting effects synchronized with the music being played. The end result was the [Musical LEDs Code](https://github.com/dhruvkasarabada/Musical-LEDs/blob/6e705838b248280943404268e7cb3a55a434190f/Musical-LEDs_SourceCode.ino)
